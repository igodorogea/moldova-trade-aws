				<source>&lt;b&gt;Warning [technical]:&lt;/b&gt; If TYPO3 is not configured to use a single character set (through $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[BE][forceCharset]) then all data entered in the backend is submitted in the character set of the selected backend language. This leads to inconsistent data storage if some users are using the backend in Russian and others in English which uses different character sets.
The solution clearly is to set the configuration option mentioned above to a value like "utf-8". This must be done by the developers responsible for the whole system configuration.</source>

&lt;b&gt;Selectorbox in top frame:&lt;/b&gt;
If set, the backend will not load the left menu frame but rather put a selector-box menu in the topframe. This saves a lot of space on small screens.

&lt;b&gt;Icons in top frame&lt;/b&gt;
This option shows all menu items in the top frame as a horizontal list of icons. This is for experienced users only who knows the order of modules and can recognize them based on their icon.</source>
